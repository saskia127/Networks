# Networks
Final assingment for the course Modelling &amp; Analysis of Complex Networks

The repository contains 9 different notebooks:

For every dataset (Cora, Citeseer and WebKB), three node classification methods were applied (1-NN, Decision tree, Graph Convolutional Network).
Each notebook contains one of these datasets with one of these methods. The data is downloaded in the notebook.
The classifiers are evaluated using accuracy and f1-score and a conditional confusion matrix is added.
